In this chapter, I will give a brief overview of several things:
First, I will shortly point to Problems that have been identified
relating to the performance of BERT. Then, I will point out some
submitted solutions countering those problems. And lastly, I will
describe my approach and elucidate the thematic of semantic roles.


\section{BERTology / Related Work}

In recent years, a lot of research went into analyzing, improving, and deluding the BERT architecture;
in the NLP field, those efforts are often referred to by the notion of ``BERTology'' (cf. \cite{rogers2020primer}).
Since it is common practice to give your enhanced/variegated BERT architecture an appropriate name --- the BERT model
trained on  a French corpus is named CamemBERT \cite{martin2019camembert}, an architecture more robust than the
standard BERT was baptized RoBERTa \cite{liu2019roberta}, etc. --- I decided to not deviate from this tradition.

The following overview is heavily based on the excellent towards-data-science article\myfootnote{\url{https://towardsdatascience.com/a-review-of-bert-based-models-4ffdc0f15d58}} by Ajit Rajasekharan.


\section{Semantic Roles}


\begin{itemize}
  \item conceptual relations that the referents of the noun phrases play with respect to the verb (palmer2010semantic)
  \item different syntactic constituents can bear same SR
  \item Linking theory: Map from syntactic surface structure to underlying predicate argument semantics
\end{itemize}

The meaning of a sentence in any natural langauge is more than an aggregate of the semantics
of its components. This is due to a number of reasons:

\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{Fixed expressions}]: In
  \item
  \item
\end{description}

``For computers to make effective use of information encoded in text, it is essential that
they be able to detect the events that are being described and the event participants.''
\citep{palmer2010semantic}

``The main reason computational systems use semantic roles is to act as a shallow meaning
representation that can let us make simple inferences that aren’t possible from the pure surface
string of words, or even from the parse tree.'' \cite[p.~375]{jurafsky2019speech}

In the literature, often \cite{gildea2002automatic} is considered to have formally defined the
task of automatic SRL.

``Analysis of semantic relations and predicate-argument structure is one of the core pieces of any
system for natural language understanding.'' \citep{palmer2010semantic}

% \section{Citations}
% Although BLEU scores should be taken with caution (see \citet{Callison-Burch2006})
% or if you prefer to cite like this: \citep{Callison-Burch2006} \ldots
%
% to cite: \cite[30-31]{Koehn2005} \\
% to cite within parentheses/brackets: \citep{Koehn2005}, \citep[30-32]{Koehn2005}\\ %\usepackage[square]{natbib} => square brackets
%
% to cite within the text: \citet{Koehn2005}, \citet[37]{Koehn2005}\\
% only the author(s): \citeauthor{Callison-Burch2006}\\
% only the year: \citeyear{Callison-Burch2006}\\

% \section{Graphics}
%
% To include a graphic that appears in the list of figures, use the predefined fig command:\\
% %\fig{#1: filename}{#2: label}{#3: long caption}{#4: width}{#5: short caption}
% \fig{images/Rosetta_Stone.jpg}{fig:rosetta}{The Rosetta Stone}{10}{Rosetta}
%
% %\reffig{#1: label}
% And then reference it as \reffig{fig:rosetta} is easy.
